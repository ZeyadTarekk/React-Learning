# Contacts

This repo is a code-along with the in-course project in the React Nanodegree program.

Most of the commits in this repository correspond to videos in the program.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the project.

2. Install the dependencies.

```
npm install
```

3a. To access the starter code, checkout the `starter` branch, then start the application.

```
git checkout starter

npm start
```

3b. Alternatively, to access the finished project, simply start the application.

```
npm start
```

Note that the Contacts app server must also be running to support the app's API calls.

## Contributing

Because this is a code-along project and the commits correspond to specific videos in the program, we will not be accepting pull requests.

If you believe that a major problem exists in the code, please open an issue to discuss the problem and potential resolution.
