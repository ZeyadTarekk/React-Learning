# JavaScript Expressions with JSX

One of the most useful features of JSX is the ability to embed JavaScript expressions directly into it. In this exercise, you'll get practice using expressions in page elements and attributes.

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
3. Open `./src/App.js`.
4. Within the `div` tag in the return statement, use JSX to embed JavaScript and render:
   - The React logo
   - The name of the library
   - Some facts about React
     Hint: you'll probably want to create at least three different elements (e.g., an `<img>` element, etc.)!
5. Visit `http://localhost:3000/` to view your application!
