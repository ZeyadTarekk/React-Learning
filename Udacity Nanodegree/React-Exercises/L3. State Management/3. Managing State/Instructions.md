# Managing State

State management is the one of the core strengths of React. In this exercise, you'll practice using `useState` to create a "like" button that tracks how many times a photo is liked. To begin:

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
3. Open `./src/App.js`.
4. Leveraging `useState`, create two variables: one to keep track of the amount of likes, and one to set the amount of likes. Be sure to initialize the amount of likes as 0.
5. Render the current amount of likes on the page.
6. Create a button that, when clicked, increments the amount of likes. Note that with each click, the amount of likes rendered on the page should increase as well.
