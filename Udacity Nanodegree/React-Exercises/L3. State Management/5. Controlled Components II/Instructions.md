# Controlled Components II

This exercise will help you to practice passing data into components, adding state to components, updating state, and creating Controlled Components.

# Task

The starter files give you a functioning app. But, as you can tell, the app isn't modular at all - there is only one component!

Your goal is to break down this app into smaller components and make them work together to achieve the same functioning application. Remember that React components should be modular, composable (i.e., can be assembled in various ways to achieve the desired result on the page), and reusable.
